# Boston-Housing-EDA-and-Regression

# üè† Boston Housing Price Prediction

This project explores various machine learning and deep learning models to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, model evaluation, and comparison of multiple regression algorithms with hyperparameter tuning. A TensorFlow neural network is also trained for performance comparison.
